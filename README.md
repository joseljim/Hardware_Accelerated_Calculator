# Hardware_Accelerated_Calculator
Hardware Accelerated Calculator implemented using a PS2 keyboard and an Altera DE10 Standard board. This calculator was based on two parts, 
the first on the FPGA which had a decoder for the keyboard where the user inputs were subsequently processed to carry out the corresponding 
operation on an ALU also designed in the FPGA. The second part of this project consisted of communicating the FPGA with the HPS and in this way 
showing the keyboard inputs as well as the results of the operations on an LCD screen which was controlled from the HPS.
